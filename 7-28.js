// #1) Men and the Hats

// Inside of a dark closet are five hats: three green and two red. Knowing this, three smart men go into the closet, and each selects a hat in the dark and places it unseen upon his head.

// Once outside the closet, no man can see his own hat. The first man looks at the other two, thinks, and says, "I cannot tell what color my hat is." 

// The second man hears this, looks at the other two, and says, "I cannot tell what color my hat is either." The third man is blind. The blind man says, 

//"Well, I know what color my hat is." What color is his hat? 



// #2) Figuring out the Money!

// Three Employees want to know the average of their salaries. They are not allowed to share their individual salaries.
// They cannot directly share their own salaries in anyway, which includes writing things down.
